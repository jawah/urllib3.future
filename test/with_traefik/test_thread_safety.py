        This test is defined to challenge the thread safety of our pooling solution. If the suite execute itself without
        error, you can be confident that the safety isn't broken. In a GIL-enabled environment, this won't bring any
        confidence. Always run that test under the free threaded build.

            - Hangs
            - SIG SEGFAULT
            - SIG ABRT
            - (stderr from libc about mem corruption)
