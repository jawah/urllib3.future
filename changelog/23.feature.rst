Added public `ConnectionInfo` class that will be present in each `HttpConnection` instance.

Passing the kwarg ``on_post_connection`` that accept a callable with a single positional argument
in ``PoolManager.urlopen`` method will result in a call each time a connection is picked out
of the pool. The function will be passed a ``ConnectionInfo`` object.
The same argument (``on_post_connection``) can be passed down to the ``HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen`` method.
